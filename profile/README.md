**ZARPL-CE** (Community Edition) is an upstream opensource version of the ZARPLY Wallet.
The opensource version is fully functional and all security, feature and UX changes are made upstream before being incorporated into the commercial version.
For the security or privacy concious this offers users full control over the ZARPLY-CE source code, and gives them the ability to build and deploy their own instance of the mobile app.

Instructions are provided for building your own ZARPLY-CE Android APK in the [ZARPLY-CE repository](https://github.com/ZARPLY/zarply-ce)

The downstream commercial version of **ZARPLY** may be found in the various mobile application stores.
**ZARPLY** has all the feature of the Community Edition but also contains the following commercial features:
- allows KYC for onboarding and offboard from ZARP to ZAR Fiat
- allows for the adding of FIAT beneficiaries to make payments directly from ZARP
- includes merchant specific functionality to allow SME's to ustilse ZARPLY for POS payments
- other finacial services such as low cost bank account with crypto friendly bank
